###The Charming Genius of the Apollo Guidance Computer

Basically about:
- how rocket is contructed
- how flight tech is done
- techniques how to make it land on the moon
- critical bugs and how many luck we had

Note:
Very nice, funny presentation, I really recommend to watch it, you won't
get much knowledge which you can use in your day by day work, but it's 
pretty nice.
