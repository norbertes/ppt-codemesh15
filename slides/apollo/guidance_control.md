###The Charming Genius of the Apollo Guidance Computer

3 questions which guidance controll system must answer:
- Which way is up?
- Where am I?
- Where am I going?

Note:
He explains how it works for spaceship, how he can navigate based on solar system 
, Deep Space Network (ping between radars and spaceship, it's on orbit, 
it won't work when you're after the moon), and backup things (rocket from earth 
etc, diffrence between USA and Russians)

USA had 3 abilities for each question to answer, Russians just one.


I've found, those questions are important not only for Apollo, but also
in work. 

I was in project, where I couldn't answer those questions. I've felt
sometihing is wrong, but couln't find what.

Your work inside project will be much more better for yourself (and motivation)
if you are able to answer them. If you know what is project goal, how you can 
accomplish it and what's left, your work will proceed much more smoothly for 
your soul.

(I've found it can also refers into our private live goals, but it's not topic 
 for now)
