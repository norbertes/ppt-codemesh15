About:
- Architecture of Facebook
- Performance problem (2013)
- Journey of Haskell inside Facebook
- 'Haskell is ready for industry'
- Haxl is very easy to use Haskell lib (2k stars @ gh)


Note:
We've migrated a 100K line codebase to a completely separate language, 
built novel infrastructure in Haskell, launched it in a crucial system, 
and grew dozens of Haskell developers, all without missing a beat. 

Come learn what blood, sweat, and tears were needed to make this Haskell success story.

TIOBE: Haskell from 9x to 3x place.
