###The Road to Running Haskell at Facebook Scale

Victories:
- GHC gave a 30% throughtput increase (after 1 yr of work on it)
- They fixed 1 bug in GC which was there for years
- Improved REPL
- Rosetta stone from translator

Note:
They worked over 1 year to rewrite their data fetch systems
In work they have fixed many issues and improved GHC at all
 
They've created snippet how to create some often used things in Haskell

They used previously (unnamed) functional language before, they had this 
increase from another fast language, think how big increment they would notice
with port from e.g. python.
