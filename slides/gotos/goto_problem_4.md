Exposed problem - people believe blindly in myth. 

I don't want to call here all history, and repeat presentation - I will just 
go to result of it:

People were calling djakistra statement 'go to statement considered harmful', 
from the newspaper, it's statement that everyone knows and cites, but no one did 
read the paper history directly. 

It doesn't metter what's the topic, always just a few % of people will try to
get their own results, get a little bit deeper knowledge of particular thing. 
We like to blindly follow trends without understanding if it's a good way 
for us or the project.

If we know one thing which will solve the problem, we will use it. Sometimes
 we have feeling that there might be better way. Why don't do even 5 minutes
 of research for an alternative? We will profit in knowledge & project will profit
 with better approach for the future.
