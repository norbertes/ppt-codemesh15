#### Harmful GOTOs, Premature Optimizations and Programming Myths are The Root of All Evil

Flat earth myth - do we have familiar myths in CS?
History of programming (Logic programming, Big O, RSA) 
Many cites of newspapers from '70 in depth focusing on topics which we all know
How time changed our perspective on learning things  

Note: 
I will focus mostly on the first one,
eg of history: Big O stands for Big Order 

Promote a culture of reading more books, 
academic papers and related material that refers to the history of our 
field and programming in general ...history from '70 which is still actual.

'Sometime ago there were books, later they were shorten into 10 minutes radio
audiences, later two minut read book column, now it's tweet'
