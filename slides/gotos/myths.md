#### Harmful GOTOs, Premature Optimizations and Programming Myths are The Root of All Evil

Often cites myths (inet):
- No unit-tests, no working code
- Procedure calls are expensive
- NoSQL is faster than traditional DBs
- 10x Engineers
- Servers are cheaper

Note: 
Procedure - because you need to call another function, pass args etc
Servers - who is going to maintain and restructure them?
